<h1><a id="DevBot_0"></a>DevBot</h1>
<p>Dev-Bot is a sms chat bot that gives interesting facts and jokes and pushes you out of my comfort zone. It is the perfect procrastinator bot, making suggestions of things to do and new places to try.</p>

<p>I was inspired by our need to constantly be entertained. I was thinking that the bot would make suggestions and prompt you to do things or try new restaurants by giving you instant suggestion based on your current state, whether you may be hungry, bored or just need some cheering up.</p>

<h3><a id="The_Approach_14"></a>The Approach</h3>
<p>I wanted to build something that has a little bit of a personality and attitude, a little bit like that friend who is always putting you to do something different. I started out with the basics, or just suggesting food options, but then thought more about expanding the conversation a little more to cover suggesting things to do in the area and adding little thumbnail pictures to the descriptions. I also used session to store user session data.</p>

<p>I created a chatbot that would make suggestions of things to do based on the mood the user is in. To achieve this, I link with the Yelp Api. I created methods that would call upon the Api based on specific keywords. The bot can also chat with you and tell you jokes and facts.</p>
